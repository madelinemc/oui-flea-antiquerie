## About:
Oui, Flea was created by an antique lover for antique lovers to showcase their collections and highlight the flea markets where they purchased them. Users get inspired by browsing through images of all the latest antiques and can get a taste of what a particular market has to offer based on other users uploads. 

Future updates include the ability to like antiques thereby saving them for the user to view.
